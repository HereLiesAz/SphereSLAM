/**
 * The previous version of this file mocked [SlamManager] itself and asserted that the mock
 * recorded a call:
 * ```
 * private val slamManager: SlamManager = mockk(relaxed = true)
 * slamManager.loadSuperPoint(assets)
 * verify { slamManager.loadSuperPoint(assets) }
 * ```
 * That proves mockk can record a call on a mock. It proves nothing about the real
 * `loadSuperPoint`/`nativeLoadSuperPoint`/`SuperPointDetector::load` path — a version that renamed,
 * broke, or stubbed the real chain to just `return true` would still pass, since nothing in that
 * test ever touched the real class.
 *
 * `libgraffitixr.so` is not on a JVM unit-test classpath (see `EvalRngSeedGuardTest`'s and
 * `SlamManagerAnchorEstablishmentTest`'s KDocs for the same constraint), so `SuperPointDetector::load`
 * itself cannot run here — that is what the NDK-backed instrumented/eval harness is for. What CAN be
 * exercised honestly from a plain JVM test, following `SlamManagerAnchorEstablishmentTest`'s pattern
 * exactly:
 *
 *  - Mock only `NativeLibLoader` (whose `loadAll()` throws off-device and would otherwise fail
 *    construction before this test gets to say anything), so a REAL, unmocked [SlamManager] can be
 *    constructed.
 *  - Call the REAL [SlamManager.loadSuperPoint] / [SlamManager.loadLowLightEnhancer] and require
 *    `UnsatisfiedLinkError` — the JVM's evidence that it genuinely tried and failed to resolve
 *    `nativeLoadSuperPoint` / `nativeLoadLowLightEnhancer` as native symbols. That error can ONLY be
 *    thrown by an actual attempt to invoke a native method; a Kotlin-side stub, a swallowed
 *    exception, or a renamed/deleted delegate would all make these tests fail instead of silently
 *    passing the way the mock-based version did.
 *
 * This bounds what these tests can catch, and the bound is worth stating: they prove the Kotlin
 * side still reaches for the correct native symbol. They say nothing about what
 * `SuperPointDetector::load` does once that symbol resolves on a real device — only an instrumented
 * run closes that gap.
