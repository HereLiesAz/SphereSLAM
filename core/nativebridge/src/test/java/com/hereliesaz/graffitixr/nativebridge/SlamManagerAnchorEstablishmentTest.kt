/**
 * `awaitAnchorTransform` must wait for an establishment NEWER than the caller's snapshot — not for
 * any anchor write, and not merely for "one has ever happened".
 *
 * Two cuts of this fix were wrong in two different ways, and both are pinned below.
 *
 * The first version of this fix set the flag inside `updateAnchorTransform`. That method is what
 * `refineAnchorFromBestPlane` calls every 30 frames *while the anchor is still unestablished*, so
 * the flag flipped within the first second of scanning and the capture never waited at all — it
 * read the plane refiner's provisional pose. The refiner builds its basis with the wall normal in
 * **Z**; establishment takes ARCore's `hitPose`, whose local **+Y** is the normal. Reading one where
 * the other is meant is a ~90° frame error by construction, and it shipped as a fix.
 *
 * The second used a boolean latch. Every target confirmation RE-establishes the anchor, so after the
 * first capture the latch is permanently true and every later capture resolves instantly — against
 * the previous anchor's pose, one GL frame before the new one is written. Re-capture is not exotic;
 * the app's own legacy-fingerprint message tells the artist to create the target again. Hence a
 * generation counter, and hence the last test here.
 *
 * **On the exceptions.** `libgraffitixr.so` is not on a JVM unit-test classpath, so every `external
 * fun` throws `UnsatisfiedLinkError`. That is not noise here, it is the instrument: a call that is
 * still waiting on the gate returns null at its timeout without ever reaching JNI, and a call that
 * has passed the gate reaches `nativeGetAnchorTransform` and throws. The two outcomes are therefore
 * unambiguous evidence of which side of the gate the coroutine is on.
 *
 * It also bounds what these tests can catch, and the bound is worth stating rather than discovering:
 * a regression that set the flag *after* `nativeUpdateAnchorTransform` would be invisible here,
 * because the throw gets there first. Off-device that is the whole method; on-device it is one line
 * of it. Only an instrumented run closes that gap.
