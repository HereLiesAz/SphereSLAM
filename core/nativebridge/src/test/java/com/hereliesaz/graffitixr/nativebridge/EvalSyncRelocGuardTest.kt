/**
 * IMPLEMENTATION.md **6a.4**, second half — the inline relocalization mode, and the same
 * "must be inert in release builds" requirement `EvalRngSeedGuardTest` covers for the seed.
 *
 * Sync mode is a *larger* release hazard than the seed, which is why it gets its own file rather
 * than a case in that one. A fixed RANSAC seed shipped to users is a behaviour change nobody would
 * feel; inline relocalization shipped to users moves a whole detect-match-solve pass onto the render
 * thread, several times a second. That is a dropped-frame bug reported as "the app stutters", with
 * no obvious path back to an evaluation affordance somebody left switched on.
 *
 * As with the seed, the effect lives in native code and cannot be exercised here — there is no
 * `libgraffitixr.so` on this classpath. What is testable is the *decision*: the gate, the cadence
 * arithmetic, and the sentinel. Those are where the realistic mistakes are.
 *
 * **On the exceptions.** As in `SlamManagerAnchorEstablishmentTest` and `EvalRngSeedGuardTest`: a
 * call that reaches JNI throws `UnsatisfiedLinkError` off-device, and a call that stops at the gate
 * returns normally. Both guard tests below exercise the REAL `SlamManager` methods, not a copy of
 * their logic, so deleting the `if (debuggable)` check from production code fails them.
