/**
 * IMPLEMENTATION.md **6a.4** — "Both must be inert in release builds."
 *
 * The seeding itself lives in native code and cannot be exercised from a JVM unit test (no
 * `libgraffitixr.so` on this classpath), so what is testable — and what actually carries the
 * requirement — is the *gate*: `setEvalRngSeedIfDebuggable` must not reach JNI when the build is
 * not debuggable.
 *
 * **On the exceptions.** `libgraffitixr.so` is not on a JVM unit-test classpath, so
 * `nativeSetEvalRngSeed` throws `UnsatisfiedLinkError` the moment it is actually invoked. That is
 * the instrument, not noise (see `SlamManagerAnchorEstablishmentTest`'s class KDoc for the same
 * technique): a call that stops at the gate returns normally, having never reached JNI, and a call
 * that passes the gate reaches `nativeSetEvalRngSeed` and throws. The two outcomes are unambiguous
 * evidence of which side of the `if (debuggable)` branch in `SlamManager.setEvalRngSeedIfDebuggable`
 * the call landed on — this exercises the REAL production method, not a copy of its logic, so
 * deleting the guard from that method fails these tests.
